- Odoo Community → Enterprise migration cannot use direct database migration (different structures)
- Client's 10-20 hour budget is tight but achievable for experienced specialist at upper limit (18-20 hours)
- Outlook 365 integration requires Azure AD app registration (may need client involvement)
- Project requires specialist expertise: migration experience, VeriFactu knowledge, Odoo Online familiarity
